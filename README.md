### Installation
Run yarn install first.
```bash
yarn install
```

After that, install Metamask extension in your browser.\
https://metamask.io/download.html \
\
Run truffle dev in project root to start truffle development server.
```bash
truffle dev
```

Register an account from the truffle development server to Metamask by login to Metamask, then click the top right icon and select "Import Account".\
\
When you finish registering, create a new network by clicking on network dropdown menu, then select "Custom RPC". Type the following:
- Network name: Anything
- New RPC Url: Your truffle network url  (http://127.0.0.1:xxxx)
- Chain ID: Type some random hex number first (e.g. 0x1234) and it will tell you an available chain ID in the network. Type that chain ID instead.

After finish creating the custom RPC, connect to that network.\
\
Now run yarn dev to start the frontend server.
```bash
yarn dev
```
Navigate to localhost:3000 to use the application.

### Usage
If everything runs correctly, you should see a popup window telling you that you are not register. Type in your public key.\
\
After that, you will be able to use the home page. Click "Add Contract" to add an account that you want to send message to. Type in their public key.\
\
For demo purpose, you will only be able to communicate with the first contract you added to your account.\
\
You can then type anything and send it to your first contract in the list.

### Debugging
The application looks like it cannot load the Metamask account
- Try redeploy your contract in truffle, then reload the page 2-3 times. (This will create a new contract and your past action (e.g. register, send message) will be reset.
```bash
truffle deploy --reset
```
All transactions are failed.
- Try resetting your Metamask account by open Metamask, click top right icon, click "Setting" > "Advanced", click "Reset Account", then reload the page 2-3 times.
